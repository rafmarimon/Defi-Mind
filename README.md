📌 Overview

DeFiMind is an open-source, AI-powered DeFi trading bot that automates yield farming across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. It continuously scans liquidity pools, analyzes APYs, and dynamically stakes/unstakes assets to maximize returns with minimal human intervention.

🌟 Features

✅ AI-Driven Strategy – Uses a neural network to optimize staking and yield farming.✅ Automated DeFi Interactions – Trades across platforms like PancakeSwap, Trader Joe, and QuickSwap.✅ Multi-Chain Support – Compatible with Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche.✅ Real-Time Market Data – Fetches APY and gas fee info from DefiLlama & Covalent APIs.✅ Smart Gas Management – Reduces transaction costs by adjusting execution timing.✅ Secure Wallet Management – Uses environment variables to protect private keys.✅ Open Source & Extensible – Designed for community collaboration and enhancements.

📦 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeFiMind.git
cd DeFiMind

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add:

PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKeyHere
WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddressHere
BSC_RPC_URL=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com

🚨 Never share your private key! Only use wallets with test funds for security.

5️⃣ Run the AI Agent

python ai_agent.py

The bot will fetch APY data, predict optimal allocations, and stake/unstake funds accordingly.

🛠️ How It Works

1️⃣ AI Model (Decision Making)

Uses TensorFlow to analyze APY trends and market conditions.

Predicts optimal fund allocation among DeFi protocols.

2️⃣ Yield Scanner (Data Collection)

Fetches real-time APY data from DefiLlama.

Monitors gas fees to optimize transaction costs.

3️⃣ Blockchain Integration

Uses Web3.py to interact with smart contracts.

Supports staking/unstaking via MasterChef contracts.

4️⃣ Auto-Execution

The bot rebalances weekly, ensuring optimal yield allocation.

# DEFIMIND

DEFIMIND is an autonomous AI agent for DeFi yield optimization. It leverages machine learning, browser automation, and self-improvement capabilities to find, analyze, and allocate funds to the best DeFi yield opportunities.

## üåü Features

- **Yield Optimization**: Automatically scans and analyzes DeFi platforms for the best yield opportunities
- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-running agent that makes decisions based on market conditions
- **Web Browser Automation**: Utilizes browser-use to interact with DeFi platforms in real-time
- **Self-Improvement**: Monitors its own performance and implements improvements automatically
- **Risk Management**: Configurable risk tolerance and position sizing
- **Communication**: Natural language updates and responses to user questions
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboard for monitoring opportunities and agent status

## üìä Components

DEFIMIND consists of several key components:

- **AutonomousAgent**: The main controller that orchestrates all components
- **YieldTracker**: Tracks and compares yields across DeFi platforms
- **YieldOptimizer**: Generates allocation and rebalancing plans based on yield data
- **DefiBrowserAgent**: Automates browser interactions with DeFi platforms
- **AgentCommunicator**: Generates natural language updates and answers user questions
- **SelfImprovement**: Monitors system performance and implements improvements

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defimind.git
cd defimind
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install browser automation dependencies:
```bash
playwright install
```

5. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ETH_RPC_URL=your_ethereum_rpc_url
```

### Running DEFIMIND

#### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run core/dashboard.py
```

#### Running the Autonomous Agent

```bash
python -m core.autonomous_agent
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

DEFIMIND is highly configurable. Main settings:

```python
config = {
    "simulation_mode": True,  # Set to False for real transactions
    "risk_tolerance": "medium",  # Options: low, medium, high
    "max_position_size_percent": 25,  # Maximum % in a single position
    "browser_headless": True,  # Run browser in background
    "rebalance_days": 7,  # Check for rebalance weekly
}
```

## üîí Security

By default, DEFIMIND runs in simulation mode with no real transactions. To run with real funds:

1. Set `simulation_mode` to `False` in the configuration
2. Provide wallet connection details (requires additional setup)
3. Start with small amounts until you're comfortable with the system

## üìù Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python run_all_tests.py
```

Individual component tests:

```bash
python test_yield_tracker.py
python test_agent_communication.py
python test_autonomous_agent.py
python test_yield_optimizer.py
```
